      <h2>My name is Jacob, and I'm a comedian, actor, writer, actor, comedian, actor, actor, writer, narcissist, virgo, and actor. And comedian.</h2>
      <p>Jacob is a comedian and now we're in the third person.</p>
      <p>As a performer, he's worked in venues around New York City as well as in festivals such as the North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival, Austin Sketch Fest, the Del Close Marathon, and the New York Fringe Festival.</p>
      <p>As a writer, you can catch his work with the UCB Maude Night team Pretty Boys or McSweeneyâ€™s Internet Tendency. He's dabbled in the hosting arts with the podcast Taking a Walk With Me, where he and a guest read a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book together. He's studied improv and sketch comedy with the greatest minds who have ever lived.</p>
      <p>He continues to be great at the UCB Theatre and The Magnet. Prior to moving to New York, Jacob performed for several years in North Carolina, both at the DSI Comedy Theater as well as with the award-winning Chapel Hill Players ("CHiPs") at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</p>
      <p>No, I don't know anything about basketball, and now we're back in the first person.</p>
