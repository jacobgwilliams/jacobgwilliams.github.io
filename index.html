      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm a web developer who laughs a lot. My journey in web development started when I was about 10 years old and sat in the computer lab at school after hours watching the older kids plunk out cheezy HTML sites dedicated to Pearl Jam.</p>
      <p>Since then I've delved deeper. I started exploring resources online to help me learn to code. Codecademy, TeamTreehouse, and others. In the summer of 2016 I enrolled at Dev Bootcamp in New York City, and completed the full-stack web developer immersion program there.</p>
      <p>Now I'd like to work with you!</p>

      <h2>More, you ask?</h2>
      <p>This isn't information pertinent to my coding abilities, but as for who I <em>am</em>, I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a BA in Drama and Communication Studies: Media Studies and Production.</p>
      <p>I moved to New York City in 2012 with creative freelancy ambitions. I've been an actor, writer, teacher, waiter, office assistant, office assistant manager, manager assistant office (wait... what?), web designer and so on.</p>
      <p>Hobbies include reading, travel, eating at restaurants well out of my price range, improv comedy, and writing.</p>
      <p>If I ever make it back to NC, my hobbies will resume being what they once were: water skiing, eating at Bojangle's (Google it), and playing with the family dog.</p>
      <p>I currently spend my free non-coding time as a house team writer for the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater's <a href="https://chelsea.ucbtheatre.com/show/1425">Maude Night team <em>Pretty Boys</em></a>, which is a bunch of weird proper nouns all basically saying I write sketch comedy.</p>
      <p>More of that stuff can be found at <a href="https://www.jacobwilliamsonline.com">my other website</a>.</p>
