  <h1>Welcome to the Almighty Marble Page</h1>

<h1>Marbles</h1>
<p>This is my page dedicated to marbles. Though they may just seem like little glass orbs, they are filled with magic and sometimes have awesome little designs in them.</p>
<h1>Why marbles?</h1>
<p>Marbles used to be the currency of magicians, children, and other marbles. It's true! The reason this page exists is to honor the memory of marbles and try to encourage the world to just use marbles as currency instead of that silly paper money.</p>
